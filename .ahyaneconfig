# The default ahyane config file.  This follows the same syntax as the header section,
# but an empty line doesn't mark the start of a "body" section.

# This file, in the ahyane base folder, sets all the defaults that are used by
# this installation of ahyane.  You should not edit this file directly. Instead,
# change the settings by putting a .ahyaneconfig file in the input directory where
# your content lives, to override just the bits you want to make different.

# Also, you can override specific arguments at the command line via --foo=bar
# or --foo="bar baz quux" for items with spaces in them.

# Typically, your call to the ahyane builder will be something like this:
# ahyane/bin/build.php --content=/Users/isaacs/blogs/foohack/
# and then you'd put the configs for that blog inside of that content folder.

# Path names are relative to the ahyane basedir, unless they start with a /, in which case,
# they're absolute.

# Lines that START with a # are comments.  But # doesn't comment out the rest of
# a line like in sh or Apache configs.
