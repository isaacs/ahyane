A CMS that works by transforming one set of files into another.

Name credit: muinamir called tind√≥miel


Usage:

Put content files in the "content" folder.  The format is similar to an email or HTTP message, with a list of key/value headers at the top, a blank line, and then the message body (contents).

Run the build.php script in the "bin" folder.  The default command is "full", but you can also specify any of the functions in the "Builder" class found in bin/classes/builder.php.

There's plenty to do besides just writing code.
