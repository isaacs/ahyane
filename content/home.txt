title: A Nifty Blog Platform for Nerds
slug: home
sortorder: -1

Ahyane started as a desire to simplify the process of writing to my blog.  I got sick of platforms that tried to do all things, and ended up being a huge memory/CPU hog for a very simple bit of HTML and text that I wanted to deliver.  I longed for a simpler time.

In typical programmer fashion, this "simplification" turned into a quite consuming side project in its own right.

There is no control panel.  There is no web back-office dashboard.  There's just a folder full of your content, a few config files, and a build script that will turn those text files into a website.  What this means is that the output is beyond Digg-proof.  This also means that it pays to be familiar with <a href="http://www.manpagez.com/man/1/rsync/">rsync</a> if you plan to use this program.

Now that the features are pretty filled out, the next step is to work on some helper scripts and packaging options.  Also, documentation would be nice.  For now, you can <a href="http://github.com/isaacs/ahyane/tree/master">fork the code</a> if you'd like, or just clone/pull it directly.  Run <code>bin/build.php</code> on the command-line, and you'll get all kinds of output.  Check the <code>.ahyaneconfig</code> file to read about what has to be changed.
