These are some of the things that need to be done.  This right here is an excerpt. Neat!

Left to do right now:

## Next Up

1. Make it simple to wire up comments to Disqus.  See the "comments" page, sibling of this one.
2. Keep blowing out the template stuff, to continue to expose data that needs to be gathered in the build step.  (Also, this is a fun creative FE design task.)
3. Packaging – Once we have configurations that are more dynamic, figure out an easy way to have a few different sites that are built from a single /bin folder.  Also, work through all the oddities with Apache rules, so that setting up a new site isn't too strange.
4. Search — Use google or yahoo to search the site.  Figure out a way to make that not suck.
5. Hierarchical static pages with a "parent" header
6. Create a single interface for "post" objects and "node" objects so that markup logic isn't repeated between archive and permalink pages. That's just awful. ContentNode should be the thing with template and content logic, and PathNode should be a thing with the path/parent/child stuff, which contains either a single ContentNode or an array of them.  That way, a single post is a single item in memory until it's written out as a markup string, no matter how many places it is seen in.  Changes to the post change it everywhere, and it will make the dependency tree stuff more possible later on.



## Bigger things

1. Dependency tree tracking, to enable incremental/partial builds and more accurate "last modified" dates on archive/feed pages.
2. Import from Wordpress
3. Stuff to ping hackernews/digg/buzz/reddit/etc.
4. Documentation – It would be good if the build command had some kind of --help or some such.
5. Write a set of shell scripts to do stuff, and a simple OSX app to wrap around them.




## Done


1. Finish up the posts-by-tags thing - abstract it into a general "archive by X" thingie. (Maybe something for author, etc?  What other metadata should be archiveable?) - Skip for now.
2. sort all the archives descending by date. - done. TW_ArchiveSort
3. paginate
4. templates
5. The default index and paginated blog posts (not by date, per se, just ordered)
6. Put titles on the archive pages.
7. Configuration – pull data out from being hard coded, and put it instead into a list of configs.  (See the "config" page, sibling of this one.)
8. Make the home page configurable
