title: Config

Config variables are read from the following places:

1. .ahyaneconfig in the bin folder
2. .ahyaneconfig file in the content folder
3. .ahyaneconfig file in the target (htdocs) folder
4. command line invocation of build.php

Settings cascade, so something on the command line overrides something in the target folder, etc.

The .ahyaneconfig in the bin folder should contain a value for every possible var, both by way of documentation as well as to keep defaults out of the code itself.
